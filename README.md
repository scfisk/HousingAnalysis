# Overview

This dataset lists monthly average home prices in various US cities from 2008 to 2020 from Zillow.

Real estate and home prices are things that are constantly on my mind as I try to build up a real
estate portfolio. Having quick access to home prices by city is useful in making future plans. This
program allows me to analyze the data for patterns and thereby better understand house prices. I 
can use this information and cross-reference it with other data from the time period to draw 
conclusions about the housing market in general and make predicitons for the future.

# Data Analysis Results
1. Which cities can the average american afford, based off an average annual income of 54,000 
   and a 20,000 down payment allowing for a 186,187 budget?
   I filtered the data to only show cities with average home price under the budget.
2. What are the 10 least expensive cities to buy a home in? 
   My program uses sorting to show the 10 least expensive cities. 


# Development Environment

I used PyCharm for my IDE - I like the UI and it's pretty inuitive for me to use.

I wrote the program in Python with the pandas library. Pandas is perfect for the simple
data analysis that was needed for this program.

# Future Work

* My questions don't allow me to take full advantage of the analysis power of pandas. I would
  like to think of better questions. 
* There's a lot more I could do to the data. I would like to add onto the program to take full
  advantage of the functionality of pandas.
* I want to improve the user experience of this program.
