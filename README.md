# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This dataset lists monthly average home prices in various US cities from 2008 to 2020 from Zillow.

Real estate and home prices are things that are constantly on my mind as I try to build up a real
estate portfolio. Having quick access to home prices by city is useful in making future plans. This
program allows me to analyze the data for patterns and thereby better understand house prices. The 
specific questions I used the data to answer were:
1. Which cities can the average american afford, based off an average annual income of 54,000 
   and a 20,000 down payment allowing for a 186,187 budget?
2. What are the 10 least expensive cities to buy a home in?
